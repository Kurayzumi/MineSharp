# MineSharp

## What does it do?

MineSharp is a simple and quite bad looking Minecraft Launcher, written in C#.\
But there's a twist: everything happens in the console!

Everything works exacty like you would expect a GUI to work, but it's just... in the *Console*!

## Setup Guide

In the Windows-Searchbar, type Terminal and press enter.\
Click on the down-arrow in the Tab-bar and select "Settings".\
Click the button next to the "Default terminal application" and select "Windows Console Host".\
You can close the window now.\
Download and extract the ZIP-File from the releases tab.\
Double-Click the `MineSharp.exe` file.\
Press `Sign In`, if you don't want to play cracked\
The rest is probably similar to any other launcher... Just way worse!
